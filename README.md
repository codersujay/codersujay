# 👋 Hi there, I'm Sujay Patil — a Curious Mind with a Passion for Code!

🌱 I’m a student with an unstoppable drive to explore the world of technology.  
💻 Currently learning the core fundamentals — not just to *write* code, but to *build* things that matter.  
🚧 I’ve already built a static website using HTML & CSS, and explored Object-Oriented Programming in C++.  
🐍 Learning Python step by step — one script at a time.

---

### 🔍 What sets me apart?

- ✨ I don't chase shortcuts — I believe in building skills from the ground up.  
- 🚀 I take small steps consistently — and aim high, always.  
- 📚 I self-learn, experiment, and iterate — because that’s where real growth begins.  
- 💡 I'm not just interested in *one* field — I explore everything with curiosity and commitment.

### 💼 Currently Working On:
- Strengthening my programming foundation  
- Learning data structures, clean code, and real-world project building  
- Practicing logic and problem-solving regularly

---

### ⚙️ Tech I’ve Played With So Far:
- 🧱 HTML & CSS (Static websites)
- 🧠 C++ (up to OOP)
- 🐍 Python (basics + curious to learn more)

---

### 📌 Long-Term Goal:
To become a versatile developer who builds meaningful tech — whether it’s a simple script or a product that touches lives.
